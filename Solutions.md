In this part of the project, a user is able to register his/her username and password and then use it to log in. Once logged in, the user is allowed to search beers using the same criteria as before: style, hop, malt, and food pairing. A new feature we added is that the user can now rate beers on a scale from 1 to 5. We keep track of the user's ratings in a separate view called "My Ratings" where users can change or delete their existing ratings. An administrator can also send and get messages using the curl command in order to update our users on important announcements to the website. These messages are displayed on the top of the webpage so that they are easy to view.
